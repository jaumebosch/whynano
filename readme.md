## Introduction

[whynano.cc](whynano.cc) is a website with the purpose of giving a simple and quick introduction and overview of the [Nano](www.nano.org) cryptocurrency. Send it to your friends and people you would like to introduce to Nano.



## Translations

Right now, the page is available in English and German. I'm hoping for people to help translate the page into more languages. To add a language, copy the [english template](languages/en.json), replace the text with the translation and rename the file to "iso-code".json (e.g. de.json for german).
